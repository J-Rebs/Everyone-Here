## Purpose of this repository 

To build out a simple script that when run returns information on upcoming calendar appointments in Microsoft Outlook. The tool is intended to look for meetings in the next 24 hours. 

## How to use

If you would like to use the executable, go to the `Exectuable` folder in this repository and download the `check_email.exe` file. 

## Who can use this

This script is free to use, but it has only been tested on a Dell Windows 11 machine. It is assumed not to work with Macs or with non-Outlook email clients. Furthermore, extensive testing of edge conditions is not complete. Use this executable at your own risk.

## Basic design 

Class: Check 

    Methods: get_meeting_info 

## Possible Future additions

1. Graphical interface with QT 
2. Add an icon for the executable
